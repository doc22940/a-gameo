## User Database

All Gameo users will create an account, which is stored in a database cloud sevice called [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). A typical user in Gameo will have the following data stored:

## Endpoints

Endpoints enables user interaction with the MongoDB Atlas database in order to constantly update their game preferences and store new games that they have added to their library or wishlist.

PyMongo is the Python wrapper for MongoDB to work in Python. See their official documentation [here](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
